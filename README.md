# PlayingWithEnergy

Welcome to "Playing with Energy," an exciting project that combines gaming with a mission to promote sustainable energy practices and reduce carbon emissions. In this innovative game, players have the opportunity to engage with an Achievement System that presents various tasks, each offering enticing rewards such as Money, Level Factor Points (LFP) that contribute to their overall level, and access to the Tech Tree. As achievements are unlocked, players can purchase items from the in-game Shop, with the unique ability to install these items on individual or multiple buildings. These installations generate energy, thereby positively impacting the player's overall progress. The ultimate objective of "Playing with Energy" is to achieve carbon neutrality, an ambitious goal that challenges players to reduce the percentage of old energy sources in favor of cleaner alternatives. Get ready to embark on a gaming journey that's not only fun but also environmentally conscious. Let's power up and save the planet, one virtual world at a time!
